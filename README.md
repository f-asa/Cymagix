# Cymagix
## Overview
**Cymagix** is an interactive application designed for exploring the visual patterns created by audio interferences. Utilizing Pygame, CuPy, and Matplotlib, this simulator offers both a 3D surface plot and a top-down view of the cymatic patterns generated by different frequencies.
